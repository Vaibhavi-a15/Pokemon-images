# Pokemon-images
This project creates a simple webpage that dynamically displays images of Pokémon sprites using the Pokémon API sprite resources. The project fetches Pokémon images from an online API and appends them to a div element in the HTML. This results in a webpage displaying all Pokémon sprites from Pokémon ID 1 to 999.
